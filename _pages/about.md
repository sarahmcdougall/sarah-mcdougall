Hi, I'm Sarah! I'm an engineer with a passion for improving our healthcare system. But there's more to me than that.

**I am a learner**. I believe that a growth mindset is mandatory for driving advancements in the healthcare field. I prefer to spend my free time reading published research in the field, exploring open-source projects, and deepening my knowledge in machine learning and analytics to see how we can develop new practices within healthcare. With very little knowledge of how the U.S. healthcare system handles adverse pregnancy outcomes in patients, I spent a year analyzing published papers on machine learning approaches to predicting maternal health outcomes, and I built my own machine learning models that predict adverse health outcomes, including preeclampsia and postpartum hemorrhaging. See <here> for a deeper look into the process.

**I am a strong communicator**. Communicating data insights to technical and non-technical audiences is crucial to this field. I excel at communicating my thought process, my discoveries, and my conclusions based on my analyses.


**I am curious**. I'm driven by a desire to understand how things work at a deeper level. While pursuing a full-time career as a software engineer, I completed a Master of Science in Data Science so I could get an inside look into the theory and applications of data science.
